PYTHON PROGRAM TO CREATE BANKACCOUNT CLASS WITH DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW FUNCTION

Task 0
Letâ€™s write a simple Python program using OOP concept to perform some simple bank operations like deposit and withdrawal of money.
First of all, define class Bankacccount

Task 2
declaring that balance is 0 using self argument then we simply print a statement welcoming to Machine. In function deposit and withdraw , amount is taken as input(in float) and is then added/subtracted to the balance. Thus resultant balance is printed in next line.

Task 3
Use an if condition to check whether there is a sufficient 
amount of money available in the account to process a fund withdrawal.
